Remarks to FIP:
	differences between FIP and IPL might be caused by rounding/truncating results
	there is a bug in FIP Kuwahara implementation - invalid for conditions when creating subareas
	why operators in .net are slower than functions? (ComplexNumber.Mul vs *)
	CMYK conversion in FIP - division by zero
